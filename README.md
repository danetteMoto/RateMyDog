# RateMyDog

I used this code for my heart-rating component: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-star-rating-input?file=src%2Fapp%2Frating-input.component.ts

I'm still looking into how to get change detection working properly in Angular. For now, I used a global variable to communicate between components. I know this is not ideal, and I will look into how to improve this code.
